# Protein-Stability-Prediction-ML-Challenge
The task in this exercise is a regression problem where you need to develop an ML model to predict a protein's thermostability (a real-valued score) using its amino acid sequence as input.

#Background: 
This exercise focuses on predicting the thermostability of proteins, a critical trait that enhances various application-specific functions in the realm of computational biology. With implications ranging from improving reaction rates in enzymatic processes to serving as prime candidates for directed evolution, accurately predicting protein thermostability is a challenge that combines complex biological understanding with computational prowess. Participants will leverage a curated dataset to develop models capable of predicting protein thermostability, using computational biology techniques to advance our understanding of protein structures and their stability.

#Motivation: 
Thermostability complements the application-specific functions of proteins, offering benefits such as operational viability at higher temperatures and serving as advantageous starting points for directed evolution. Its significance in protein engineering and the inherent challenges in predicting thermostability, given its potential for abrupt changes from minor amino acid substitutions, underscores the importance of this competition.

#Landscape:
The dataset for this competition is curated from an extensive screening landscape, utilizing a mass spectrometry-based assay to measure protein melting curves. This dataset encompasses both global and local variations in protein sequences, offering a comprehensive view of how sequence variations influence thermostability.
